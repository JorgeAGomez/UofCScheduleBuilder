Topics include: introduction to research design and multivariate methods, linear regression, logistic regression, analysis of variance and covariance, multivariate analysis of variance, discriminant analysis, principal components analysis, common factor analysis, and additional multivariate topics if time permits. The technical level of treatment would require basic understanding of matrix and linear algebra and at least one first level course in statistics.
